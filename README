I'm Away
========

Are you stepping away from you computer but need to run it anyway? Are you
concerned about the power consumption? Are you bothered by turning all the
monitors off manually?

We have a solution!

You run the I'm Away tool and all your displays will automaticaly turn off a
minute later. If something wakes them up while you're away, they'll get turned
off again.

Once you get back, you press the "I'm back" button and you're done! Your power
settings will get restored to the way they were before you started the app.
